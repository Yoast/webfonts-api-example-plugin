# webfonts-api-example-plugin
An example plugin, using the Webfonts API from https://github.com/aristath/webfonts-api

## Instructions:

* Use the twentytwentyone default theme.
* Install and activate the webfonts API plugin from https://github.com/aristath/webfonts-api/ - or just use the direct zip download (https://github.com/aristath/webfonts-api/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Install and activate this plugin (https://github.com/aristath/webfonts-api-example-plugin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Go to the customizer, and you'll see a new "Webfonts API Example" section. You can select a font-family there, and it will be applied both in the frontend and the editor.

The selection of font-families shown in the customizer was completely random, just the top ones that appeared when I opened Google-fonts.
